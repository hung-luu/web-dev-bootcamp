<p>Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I
    personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977, and sales of its
    computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. They went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the
    next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original
    Macintosh, announced with the critically acclaimed advert "1984". However, the high price of its products and
    limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed
    Apple amicably,[15] while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him.</p>
